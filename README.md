# Eye state detection project
This project compares different machine learning models in terms of use for eeg signals. This is the preparation for your own data set and its processing.

The complete documentation is attached as a pdf file.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/markwallbang/eeg-eye-state

All data is from one continuous EEG measurement with the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. The duration of the measurement was 117 seconds. The eye state is the last column ('1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state). All values are in chronological order.
